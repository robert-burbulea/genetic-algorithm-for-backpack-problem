This project is inspired from the [knapsack problem]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem)). 
Instead of [solving]([url](https://dev.to/downey/solving-the-knapsack-problem-with-dynamic-programming-4hce)) it using dynamic programming, it runs a genetic algorithm using mutations and crossover functions, based on the number of generations given as input. A more in-depth explanation can be found [here]([url](https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/genetic-knapsack/)).
The solution given is not perfect, but given enough generations, it gets close enough to the real answer. This solution is useful for problems that are hard to compute, such as NP-hard problems.
